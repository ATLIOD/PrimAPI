Gorillas are the largest living primates and inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. | Gorillas are divided into two species: the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei), each with two subspecies. | Mountain gorillas, a subspecies of eastern gorillas, are known for their thicker fur, which helps them survive in colder, high-altitude environments. | Gorillas are primarily herbivores, with a diet consisting mainly of leaves, stems, bamboo shoots, and some fruits. | Gorillas live in social groups called troops, which are led by a dominant male known as a silverback due to the silver hair on his back. | Silverbacks are responsible for protecting their troop from danger and making decisions about where the group will forage and rest. | Gorillas are highly intelligent and have been observed using tools in the wild, such as using sticks to test water depth or using leaves as napkins. | Gorillas communicate using a variety of vocalizations, including grunts, barks, and screams, as well as body language, such as chest-beating. | Chest-beating is a behavior mainly exhibited by silverbacks to assert dominance, attract mates, or signal a warning to rivals. | Gorillas build nests each day for resting, either on the ground or in trees, using branches and leaves to create a comfortable platform. | Female gorillas typically give birth to one infant after a gestation period of about 8.5 months. | Gorilla infants stay with their mothers for several years, learning essential survival skills and developing strong bonds. | Gorillas are known for their gentle and peaceful nature, but they can become aggressive when threatened or defending their troop. | The knuckle-walking locomotion is a distinctive feature of gorillas, where they walk on all fours with their fingers curled inwards. | Gorillas play a vital role in their ecosystems by dispersing seeds and helping to maintain forest diversity. | The western lowland gorilla, a subspecies of the western gorilla, is the most numerous gorilla subspecies, but they are still classified as critically endangered. | Gorillas face numerous threats, including habitat loss due to deforestation, poaching for bushmeat, and the spread of diseases. | Conservation efforts, such as anti-poaching patrols and community-based tourism, are crucial for protecting gorilla populations. | Mountain gorillas were brought back from the brink of extinction through intensive conservation efforts, but they remain endangered. | Gorillas share about 98% of their DNA with humans, making them one of our closest living relatives.
