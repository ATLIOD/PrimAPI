Chimpanzees are one of our closest living relatives, sharing approximately 98% of their DNA with humans. | Chimpanzees are native to West and Central Africa, where they inhabit rainforests and woodlands. | Chimpanzees live in large communities, often consisting of 20 to 150 individuals, with complex social hierarchies. | Chimpanzees communicate using a variety of vocalizations, including grunts, screams, and pant-hoots. | Chimpanzees are omnivores, eating a wide variety of foods, including fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and sometimes meat. | Chimpanzees are highly intelligent and are known to use tools in the wild, such as using sticks to extract termites from mounds. | Chimpanzees often make and use tools, with some even using stones to crack open nuts. | Chimpanzees have strong family bonds, with mothers playing a critical role in raising their young for many years. | Chimpanzees are one of the few animals known to hunt cooperatively, with groups working together to catch and share meat from smaller primates. | Chimpanzees have the ability to learn sign language and can understand human gestures and symbols to communicate. | Chimpanzees exhibit a range of emotions, from joy and laughter to grief and mourning, and they have been observed comforting each other. | Chimpanzees are able to learn from experience and can problem-solve, even in situations that involve complex tasks. | Chimpanzees are arboreal, meaning they spend time in trees, but they also travel on the ground, walking on all fours. | Chimpanzees build nests in trees to sleep in, creating new nests each night using branches and leaves. | Chimpanzees live to be about 33 years old in the wild, though they can live longer in captivity. | Chimpanzees use facial expressions to communicate their feelings, with smiles, grins, and frowns conveying different messages. | Chimpanzees engage in social grooming, which helps to reinforce bonds and remove parasites from each other's fur. | Chimpanzees have long arms and can swing through trees with great agility, a skill known as brachiation. | Chimpanzees are known to use leaves and sticks as makeshift tools for drinking water by soaking up liquid with the leaves. | Chimpanzees can exhibit behaviors that resemble human culture, such as passing down tool-making traditions across generations. | Chimpanzees are very curious and enjoy exploring their environment, which helps them adapt to new situations. | Chimpanzees often engage in play, including chasing, wrestling, and mock fighting, which helps them develop social skills. | Chimpanzees are capable of complex thought, and they can recognize themselves in mirrors, an ability once thought to be uniquely human. | Chimpanzees are endangered due to habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade, with populations continuing to decline. | Chimpanzees are important seed dispersers in their ecosystems, helping maintain forest diversity by eating fruit and spreading seeds. | Chimpanzees are known for their impressive strength, capable of lifting heavy objects and overpowering other animals when needed. | Chimpanzees can live for decades in captivity, with some individuals reaching over 60 years of age. | Chimpanzees use rocks to dig for underground insects and roots, showcasing their ingenuity in finding food. | Chimpanzees have been observed using medicinal plants to treat illnesses, demonstrating a form of self-medication. | Chimpanzees have large, expressive eyes and a high degree of social intelligence, making them one of the most studied primates in the world.
