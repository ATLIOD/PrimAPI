Proboscis monkeys are native to the island of Borneo, where they live in the rainforests of Malaysia and Indonesia. | Proboscis monkeys are easily recognized by their large, distinctive noses, which are much larger in males than in females. | The large nose of a proboscis monkey is thought to amplify its vocalizations, helping it communicate with other members of its group. | Proboscis monkeys are arboreal, spending most of their time in trees but also traveling on the ground to find food and water. | Proboscis monkeys are primarily folivores, meaning their diet consists mainly of leaves, but they also eat fruits and seeds. | Proboscis monkeys live in social groups, usually consisting of a dominant male and several females with their offspring. | Proboscis monkeys are excellent swimmers, and they are one of the few primates that enjoy water. They can even dive to escape predators. | Proboscis monkeys have a distinctive, rounded pot-bellied appearance due to their large stomachs, which help them digest the fibrous leaves they eat. | Proboscis monkeys have webbed feet, which make them strong swimmers and help them navigate the rivers and marshes of their habitat. | Proboscis monkeys use their long, prehensile tails for balance as they move through the trees. | The proboscis monkey's diet is rich in leaves from the mangrove, fig, and other trees native to Borneo's rainforests. | Proboscis monkeys are typically found in mangrove forests, riverine forests, and lowland rainforests near rivers and wetlands. | Proboscis monkeys communicate using a variety of vocalizations, including honks, grunts, and whistles, which are amplified by their large noses. | Proboscis monkeys are mainly diurnal, meaning they are active during the day and rest at night in trees. | Proboscis monkeys have a relatively low reproductive rate, with females giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of around 166 days. | The males' large noses are thought to play a role in attracting females, as larger noses are more likely to signal health and dominance. | Proboscis monkeys are endangered due to habitat loss, hunting, and the destruction of their rainforest habitat. | Proboscis monkeys have a strong sense of smell, which is aided by their large noses and helps them find food and communicate with other monkeys. | Proboscis monkeys use their long noses to create loud honking sounds, which serve to warn other group members of danger or to communicate their presence. | The large size of the proboscis monkey's nose helps with heat regulation, especially in the hot and humid tropical environments they inhabit. | Proboscis monkeys are often seen near water, where they forage for food and can escape predators by swimming. | The males of the species are usually the dominant individuals in the group, and they protect their females and offspring from threats. | Proboscis monkeys have relatively short limbs compared to other monkeys, but their large stomachs and powerful jaws help them process their tough, fibrous diet. | Proboscis monkeys are important to the health of their ecosystems, as they help spread seeds and pollens through their diet. | Proboscis monkeys' habitat in Borneo is at risk due to deforestation, particularly from palm oil plantations, which threaten their survival. | Proboscis monkeys are known to be social animals, forming strong bonds within their groups and often engaging in grooming and other social behaviors. | Proboscis monkeys are capable of leaping between trees, although they tend to move more slowly than other monkeys due to their large size. | Proboscis monkeys are primarily vegetarian, but they may occasionally eat insects or small animals if the opportunity arises. | Proboscis monkeys have a remarkable ability to balance on thin branches, using their tails for support as they feed and move through the trees. | Proboscis monkeys are a symbol of Borneo's unique wildlife, and they are an iconic species for conservation efforts in the region.
