Golden monkeys are native to the mountainous forests of Central and East Africa, primarily found in Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. | Golden monkeys are known for their striking golden-orange fur on their backs and limbs, with black fur on their faces and tails. | Golden monkeys live in large, cohesive groups, called troops, that can range from 20 to 60 individuals. | Golden monkeys are primarily herbivores, with a diet that includes leaves, fruits, flowers, and bamboo shoots. | Golden monkeys are arboreal, meaning Golden monkeys spend much of their time in the trees, although Golden monkeys will occasionally descend to the forest floor to forage. | Golden monkeys are closely related to the endangered blue monkey, with which Golden monkeys share their habitat and some similar traits. | Golden monkeys are active during the day (diurnal) and spend their time foraging, playing, and socializing within their troops. | The golden monkey has a relatively small range compared to other primates, which makes Golden monkeys vulnerable to habitat destruction and human activities. | Golden monkeys are highly social animals, and Golden monkeys engage in grooming, vocalizations, and playing to strengthen social bonds within their group. | Golden monkeys give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of about 5-6 months. | The golden monkeyâ€™s fur is a vibrant golden-orange, which provides camouflage in the dappled sunlight of the forest canopy. | Golden monkeys are critically endangered, mainly due to habitat loss from deforestation and human encroachment. | The IUCN Red List classifies golden monkeys as "Endangered," with only a few thousand individuals remaining in the wild. | Golden monkeys are typically found in montane forests at altitudes between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. | Golden monkeys are known to have a complex vocal communication system that includes high-pitched calls used to communicate within their troops. | The golden monkey is an important species for ecotourism in Rwanda, where visitors can go on guided treks to see Golden monkeys in the Volcanoes National Park. | Golden monkeys play a vital role in their ecosystem by helping to disperse seeds, particularly from the fruits and berries Golden monkeys eat. | Golden monkeys are most active in the morning and late afternoon, often foraging for food before resting during midday. | Golden monkeys have a very selective diet, often choosing specific types of leaves or fruits based on their nutritional content and seasonal availability. | The young golden monkey is born with soft, light-colored fur that gradually darkens as it matures into its adult golden-orange coloration.
